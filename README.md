## Summary

Penetration Tester and Security Analyst with hands-on experience in Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration
Testing (VAPT), Web and Network Security, and Threat Analysis. Proficient with tools such as Metasploit, Burp
Suite, Nmap, and Wireshark, and skilled in Python and Bash scripting. CEH v13 certification in progress, with
practical exposure through labs, internships, and real-world projects. Developed MetaWarden, a metadata
detection and privacy risk analysis tool, as part of my final year project for the BSc Cyber Security, which I
completed with First-Class Honours, demonstrating expertise in secure application development and forensic
analysis. Strong in documentation, reporting, and continuously advancing both offensive and defensive
cybersecurity skills. Plans to pursue CompTIA Security+ post-CEH.

## Projects

### [MetaWarden: Metadata Detection & Privacy Risk Analysis Tool – Final Year Project](https://github.com/mhjshmr/MetaWarden)
- Developed a Python and Flask app to detect, analyze, and remove sensitive image metadata.
- Built a web interface with metadata extraction, privacy scoring (EXIF: GPS, device info, timestamps), and downloadable reports.
- Tested edge cases for robustness, achieving 97.14% detection accuracy.

### DDoS Attack Simulation & Mitigation
- Simulated DDoS attacks using hping3, LOIC, and Wireshark to study network behavior under stress.
- Analyzed packet-level traffic and tested mitigation strategies for effectiveness.
- Documented results and recommended optimal countermeasures to improve network security.

### Hands-on Penetration Testing Lab (HackTheBox, TryHackMe, VulHub)
- Simulated real-world attacks across web, network, and system layers in a controlled lab.
- Web Pentesting: Identified SQLi, XSS, and RCE using Burp Suite and Sqlmap. Manually exploited session management flaws.
- Active Directory: Performed Kerberoasting, Pass-the-Hash, and lateral movement using BloodHound, Mimikatz, and PowerView.
- System Exploitation: Gained root/system access on misconfigured Linux/Windows hosts using Metasploit and manual privilege escalation.

### [Virtual Cybersecurity Experiences](#)
- **Datacom** – Network security & incident response tasks.
- **Mastercard** – Phishing detection and user awareness training design.
- **Tata** – Security operations & vulnerability assessment practice.
